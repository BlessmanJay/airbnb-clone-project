# Project Overview: AirBnB Clone

The AirBnB Clone Project is a web-based frontend application designed to replicate the core user interface and features of the original Airbnb platform. It showcases essential functionalities like viewing property listings, filtering search results, and displaying individual property details. This clone project is ideal for learning and demonstrating frontend development skills.

Project Goals
Recreate the visual structure and layout of Airbnb's main pages (e.g., homepage, listings page, property details page).

Practice and demonstrate mastery of modern frontend development tools and best practices.

Implement responsive design to ensure the website works seamlessly across desktop and mobile devices.

Simulate user interactions such as searching, filtering, and navigating pages (without backend logic).
